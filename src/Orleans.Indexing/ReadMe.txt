Porting the Indexing Code
-------------------------

Purpose
-------

Port the Indexing code to the latest Orleans runtime.

Nomenclature
------------

In this document I shall refer to the working implementation of the indexing
code written by Mohammad Dashti as V1 and the port of the code, which I am
currently writing as V2. The V1 code uses .NET 4.5.1 while V2 uses .NET
Standard 2.0. In addition V1 is based on an old version of the Orleans runtime
while V2 is based on the latest version of the Orleans runtime. In this
document, I refer to the roots of the V1 and V2 clones of the Git repositories
as <V1> and <V2> respectively. 

Status 
------

I have copied most of the indexing code from V1 to V2 and created some tests as
described below. About 2/3 of the indexing code compiles and is now part of the
assembly. The code that I copied is taken from the OrleansIndexing directory of
V1. This is not all of the code that has to be ported. In order to make
indexing work in V1, some modifications were made to the Orleans runtime. These
modifications have not been moved to V2 as yet.

  Xiao is a developer in the current Orleans project and has helped
  me set up the tests.


What is Orleans?
----------------

Here is my understanding. Orleans is a framework for implementing a distributed
service. It is composed of Silos (servers) and Grains (service classes). The
location of the Grains are virtual. I think of them as equivalent to a virtual
memory system where memory pages can be swapped to and from disk without the
uses knowledge. In the same way a Grain can be moved to and from disk or Silos
as the Orleans system requires but the user can always access a specified Grain
and Orleans will make sure you get access to it. Indexing is a way of accessing
multiple Grains with a given value of the indexed property. 

How does Indexing work?
-----------------------

In V1, Grains are marked indexable by inheritance. The properties of the grain
that are to be indexed are marked using .NET annotations. At Silo startup time,
all the classes in the assembly are searched for indexable classes and their
indexed properties using reflection. A dictionary is created in the Silo for
each of the Class-IndexProperty types. This dictionary will keep track of the
values of the property and a list of the Grains that have been assigned a
particular value to that property. The dictionary contains a description of the
index, not the index itself. For example, it identifies the indexed classes,
the indexed properties of each indexed class, and the physical index type of
each index (e.g., partitioned by silo or by index value). For example, suppose
there is a grain type called Engineer which has an indexable property called
Name, the corresponding dictionary will effectively be a function of type:
string -> Grain list, that is, you give the function a name and it will return
a list of all the Engineer grains that have that value for a Name. The indexes
themselves are ordinary grains, e.g., the mapping of Engineer.name -> grain
list.



Strategy
--------

In the ideal world all that would have to be done is copy over the indexing
files from V1 to V2 build, and run. Unfortunately the porting process is not
that easy as a number of difficulties have arisen. This includes:

    - dropping of inheritance from the runtime architecture
    - access to the current Silo has changed
    - etc

Git Repositories
----------------

    V1: https://github.com/OrleansContrib/Orleans.Indexing.git
    V2: https://github.com/KirkOlynyk/orleans.git

    (by the way in V2 I work in the 'develop' branch)


Work Item: Clone these repositories

If you wish, in our porting job V1 is the source and V2 is the destination.

The V1 code base is never touched. All changes are made on the V2 side. I have
not settled on a strategy for having someone other than me contribute to V2.
For now I suppose you could create a branch to work on and then submit a pull
request to me. I work in the V2 'develop' branch and check in early and often.
If you want to see my latest progress, look there.

I work by cloning both of the repositories above and working side by side. I
have already copied most of indexing code from V1 to V2. To see how indexing
works I run tests in V1 and trace it in the debugger. Then I create a similar
test in V2 and compare. Of course there are some complications.


Accessing the current Silo
--------------------------

The dictionary described earlier (under “How does indexing work?”) is loaded
into a silo when the silo starts up. It is in a protected area that is only
accessible by the Orleans runtime. The API that the V1 code uses to access to
the silo, and hence the dictionary, is not supported in the latest Orleans
release. So, as of of 2/5/2018 there is no access to the current Silo in the
indexing code. This means that some of the V1 indexing code will not compile.
In order to get around this so I could make progress I have commented out some
sections of code that will not compile in the V2 environment. These are
sections are marked in the following manner

    #if false
        Code that accesses current Silo
    #endif

The affected files are listed below in "What is done, what is not".

Using the Test Framework
------------------------

Enable Test Framework debugging on your development machine
-----------------------------------------------------------

In order to run the Tests under the Test Explorer in Visual Studio you must
change the settings under

Test -> Test Settings -> Default Processor Architecture ->X64

Compiling the Test Framework
---------------------------

This is the way that I do it. It works but I am not sure that it is optimal.

- Open the Solution Explorer window
- Right Click on the Test Directory
- Choose 'Rebuild'
- After the build is successful, open the Team Explorer
  by choosing 'Test -> Windows -> Test Explorer'

Because the tests have just been built, the Test Explorer will take some time
scanning the tests for those annotated with [Fact]. You search for your test by
typing the name of the test in the search box. The name of your test should be
filtered to into the list.

- Right click on your test name in the Test Explorer window and choose to Run or
  Debug. If you choose to Debug, make sure you have a break point set somewhere
  in your test code.

- After running the test you can check the output to the Test output window by
  going to the Test Explorer window and clicking on "Output" at the bottom of the
  window. An output window will appear just underneath the Test Explorer window.
  You can also get the same output by looking at the log file generated in the
  logs directory, in my case it is located in

  orleans\test\Orleans.Indexing.Tests\bin\Debug\net461\win10-x64\logs

  Your version will vary appropriately.

Adding your own test to the Test Framework
------------------------------------------
Each test is marked with a [Fact] annotation.


Enable Code Generation in the Test Framework
--------------------------------------------

Insert the following line in the test's (and any other grain application)
.csproj file:

<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <BlahBlahBlah> ... </BlahBlahBlah>
    ....
    <OrleansBuildTimeCodeGen>true</OrleansBuildTimeCodeGen> <-- add this!
  </PropertyGroup>
  ...
</Project>


Suggested Work
--------------

When a grain is activated on the server side it calls the following code.

[<V2>\orleans\src\Orleans.Runtime\Catalog\Catalog.cs]

namespace Orleans.Runtime {
  internal class Catalog {
    public ActivationData GetOrCreateActivation(
            ActivationAddress address,
            bool newPlacement,
            string grainType,
            string genericArguments,
            Dictionary<string, object> requestContextData,
            out Task activatedPromise)
  }
}

What is done, what is not
-------------------------

I have copied all the V1 files under the src\OrleansIndexing directory to the
V2 project under src\Orleans.Indexing. I changed the name in order to be more
consistent with the naming conventions used in the V2 project. In addition to
moving the files I have changed <V2>\orleans.sln to include the new files in
the build. There are a total of 90 .cs files that were copied from V1 to V2,
and most of them compile with only minor modifications. These modifications
included putting "I" in front of interface definitions and adding "this." in
front of reference to class member references. These were required by the
current style requirements of my project. I am not sure if these requirements
were part of the solution as written by the Orleans team or just a default of
my Visual Studio. In any case I made the cosmetic changes in order to get the
build to work.

Here is a list of files that have some or all their code commented out with #if
false .. #endif brackets in order to get the build to work:

- Core\FaultTolerance\IndexableGrain.cs
- Core\FaultTolerance\IndexWorkflowQueueBase.cs
- Core\FaultTolerance\IndexWorkflowQueueHandlerBase.cs
- Core\FaultTolerance\IndexWorkflowQueueHandlerSystemTarget.cs
- Core\FaultTolerance\IndexWorkflowQueueSystemTarget.cs
- Core\FaultTolerance\ReincarnatedIndexWorkflowQueue.cs
- Core\FaultTolerance\ReincarnatedIndexWorkflowQueueHandler.cs
- Core\IndexableGrainNonFaultTolerant.cs
- Core\IndexFactory.cs
- Core\IndexRegistry.cs
- Core\Utils\SiloUtils.cs
- Core\Utils\TypeCodeMapper.cs
- Extensions\GrainExtensions.cs
- Extensions\GrainFactoryExtensions.cs
- Extensions\IndexExtensions.cs
- Indexes\ActiveIndexes\ActiveHashIndexPartitionedPerKeyBucketImpl.cs
- Indexes\ActiveIndexes\ActiveHashIndexPartitionedPerSiloBucketImpl.cs
- Indexes\ActiveIndexes\ActiveHashIndexPartitionedPerSiloImpl.cs
- Indexes\ActiveIndexes\ActiveHashIndexSingleBucketImpl.cs
- Indexes\HashIndexPartitionedPerKeyBucket.cs
- Indexes\HashIndexSingleBucket.cs
- Indexes\StorageManagedIndexes\DirectStorageManagedIndexImpl.cs
- Indexes\TotalIndexes\TotalHashIndexPartitionedPerKeyBucketImpl.cs
- Indexes\TotalIndexes\TotalHashIndexSingleBucketImpl.cs
- Query\OrleansQueryProvider.cs
- Query\QueryIndexedGrainsNode.cs
- Scanners\ActiveGrainEnumeratorGrain.cs
- Scanners\ActiveGrainScanner.cs

That is a total of 28 files, about a third of all the files. I don't think that
this is a disaster. A large portion of the build difficulties arise from the
fact that V2 no longer supports access to the interface IRuntimeClient " .. a
subset of the runtime API that is exposed to both silo and client ..."

In the neutered code list above there are many reference to 

  RuntimeClient.Current

which must be resolved in the port to V2.

Tests
-----

I have created a number of tests in V2. One set of tests uses the .NET Test
framework provided in Visual Studio. It made part of the larger test suite
written by the Orleans team. My part of this suite is found in

  <V2>\test\Orleans.Indexing.Tests
    Develop.cs
    SimpleTests.cs

These files contain several tests that can be run individually in the test
suite framework.

- Orleans.Indexing.Tests.Develop.IndexSimpleTest2

    This is a test that inspects the assembly and finds "Indexable" grains and
    properties in a manner that follows the Silo initialization procedure in V1.
    The idea was to create the same dictionaries as are created in V1. This work
    is unfinished.

- Orleans.Indexing.Tests.SimpleTests.Test1

    This creates a grain of our construction using the new grain registration
    procedure of V2.


Building V2
-----------

This is what I do. I am not sure that it is optimal. First I build from the
command line. Build the project using the build.cmd script

root> build.cmd

Then, from the root directory, I start "Orleans.sln". Once again, I build the
entire project. Not sure if this is necessary but that is what I do.

Building and Running the Test suite
-----------------------------------

This assumes that you have modified the test code. Inside Visual Studio, I
highlight "test" in the Solution Explorer, right click and build.

IMPORTANT: Make sure that the test targets x64. To do this click
"Test->Test Settings->Default Processor Architecture->x64"

After the build make sure that you have made the Test Explorer window visible.
This is done by going to the top menu bar and clicking "Test->Windows->Test
Explorer"

After building the test suite, the Test Explorer will look into the code and
search for those functions that have been annotated with [Fact]. After some
time, the Test Explorer will present a list of all such marked tests. You can
use the search dialog to find your particular test. From that you right click
on that test and choose to view, run or debug. If you wish to debug then make
sure that you have set a break point somewhere in your code.

Building V1
-----------

cd <V1>
build.cmd

or

- cd <V1>\src
- open Orleans.sln with Visual studio
